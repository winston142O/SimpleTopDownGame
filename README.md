# SimpleTopDownGame
A simple top-down RPG style game made with Pygame.

I worked on this game for about a week as a little project on the side while I was
moving from one city to another to start college. 

It's a very simple game that uses game sprites and graphics made by creators Pixel-Boy and AAA.
The sprite pack can be found here: https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack

As I said before, it's a very simple game so it only features a combat system, with very retro-style enemy
AI, and a simple level up menu for character abilities. The character has a couple different weapons and magic spells
available to use.

The controls are:

  - Arrow keys for movement.
  - Space for attack
  - CTRL for magic
  - Q to switch weapon
  - E to switch magic spell
  - M to show level up menu
